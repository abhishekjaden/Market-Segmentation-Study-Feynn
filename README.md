## 📈 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of my 2nd internship project at **Feynn Labs**, focusing on **Market Segmentation**.

It involves analyzing customer preferences and perceptions of McDonald's, and segmenting customers into meaningful groups. This enables businesses to better target marketing strategies and customize products or services according to different customer needs.

## 🔍 Objective
- Understand and replicate the **10 steps of Market Segmentation Analysis** as described in the provided study material.
- Apply these steps to a real-world case study dataset (McDonald's).
- Implement clustering models in Python to identify and visualize market segments.

---

## 🛠️ Techniques & Tools Used
- **Data Exploration & Cleaning:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Clustering Models:**
  - **KMeans Clustering:** identified optimal clusters using Elbow Method (WCSS), performed segmentation, and plotted PCA projections with cluster centroids.
  - **Hierarchical Clustering:** used dendrograms to visualize linkage distances and Agglomerative Clustering for segmentation.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for 2D visualization of high-dimensional data.

## 🧑‍💻 What this project demonstrates
✅ Classical unsupervised machine learning techniques to extract market segments.  
✅ Both **visual representation** (PCA scatter plots, dendrograms) and **numerical model summary** (cluster centers table) to interpret and profile segments.  
✅ Structured analysis following business-oriented market segmentation methodology.

## 🚀 How to run
1. Clone this repository or download the notebook file.
2. Open `Market_SegmentationV1.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
3. Ensure the required Python packages are installed (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `scipy`).
4. Run all cells to see data exploration, clustering models, dendrograms, and cluster profiles.

## 📊 Summary of Insights
- Using both KMeans and hierarchical clustering, the customers were segmented into meaningful groups based on their perceptions of McDonald's (e.g., yummy, cheap, healthy).
- Visualizations made it easy to understand how customers cluster together and what each segment values most.
- Cluster centers were computed to numerically describe the characteristics of each market segment.
